## General Questions

### What is Deployment Live Cloud Ready Deployment and Recovery Tool?

It's a version of the popular [ipxe](https://ipxe.org) network boot loader, that has been tailored for Windows Operating System Deployment and Recovery.

The **Deployment Live iPXE** binary itself is very small, around 400Kb to 500Kb in size. And can be started via USB, PXE, HTTPS, and more.

Once you have started **Deployment Live iPXE** we can guide you through various deployment and recovery scenarios. 

This product was designed to assist IT departments and end users with the task of recovering machines:
* If the machine has been attacked by Malware.
* If the machine has a critical issue like the CrowdStrike Bug from 2024.
* Or if the Operating System has simply stopped working. 

### What Makes it so Special?

iPXE has been around for a while, it's an ideal network boot loader that uses modern HTTP/HTTPS for communication, 
but so far, no one has publicly released a general version that is signed by Microsoft for Secure Boot.

iPXE with HTTPS can start the Deployment and Recovery process from the cloud, 
and a cloud server is ideal for recovery in malware scenario if all resources in a company have been compromised.

Additionally, with the advent of HTTPS booting in newer UEFI firmware, we now have the ideal delivery mechanism 
for machines with HTTPS. Now even home users can recover quickly and efficiently when things go wrong. More to follow. 

### Where can I get this product:

#### ISO Images

You can mount these ISO images within Hyper-V, or use tools like [Rufus](https:://rufus.ie) to copy to USB Keys.

Why use either USB or NET?  Well USB (sometimes called DRV) versions of iPXE have support for some external USB to Ethernet Adapters.
However, sometimes when iPXE initializes the USB bus, it looses connectivity with some USB Keyboards. So best to use the USB version only if REQUIRED!

If booting from HTTPS, you may wish to use the CA.crt below, and the URL: https://boot.deploymentlive.com:8050/... 

#### HP Boot Files

**Deployment Live iPXE** supports HP Sure Recover out of the box! 

You will need to create a Sure Recover payload using `New-HPSureRecoverImageConfigurationPayload`.
It will require your Signing key, the URL to boot, and the Image Certificate below.

## Scripting

### How to create a Hyper-V Machine for DHCP Proxy:

```
#Requires -RunAsAdministrator
# Create iPXE DHCP Proxy (No Disk,1GB RAM)

[cmdletbinding()]
param(
    $Name = 'iPXE DHCP Proxy',    
    $SwitchName = ( Get-VMSwitch -SwitchType External | Select -first 1 -ExpandProperty Name ),
    $ISOPath
)

if ( !$ISOPath ) { 
    $ISOPath = "$env:temp\DeploymentLiveiPXE_x64.iso"
    Invoke-WebRequest -Uri 'https://www.deploymentlive.com/iso/snp_DRV_x64.efi.iso' -OutFile $ISOPath

## Troubleshooting

### Ubuntu won't download on my Hyper-V Machine.

If there is not enough ram to store the file, the download can fail. 
VM's testing out Windows and/or Ubuntu live should have **8GB** of RAM. (Sorry)

### I found a bug, how do I report it?

https://github.com/DeploymentLive/iPXEOps/issues

## Misc questions

### Does **Deployment Live iPXE support wireless recovery?

Currently not supported, but may be supported in the future. 



## Licensing Questions

### What kind of Licensed versions are there?

* **Deployment Live iPXE - Unsigned** - All unsigned versions of iPXE fall under `GPL 2.0` You are allowed to copy and distribute at will.</br>
Full Binaries can be found at: https://github.com/DeploymentLive/ipxebuilder under releases.
* **Deployment Live iPXE - Public Version** - We have also taken the Un-Signed binaries above, and aggregated a Secure Boot digital signature at the end of the binary.</br>
These files are public (see above), do not re-distribute, use the links above to download. Note that the public versions contain only **ONE** trusted CA cert: `Deployment Live CA`. See above.
* **Deployment Live iPXE - Enterprise Version** - In addition to public signed version, there is also a Enterprise version with a Secure Boot digital signature aggregated at the end.</br>
In addition to the Signed **Public Version** above, this version has full trust with all Mozilla trusted Certificate Authorities, and other enhanced features like Peer to Peer support.

How do you get the **Enterprise Version**? Please contact us for more information info@deploymentlive.com

### What if I want to develop my own Recovery Solution?

The public version allows you to create your own version, and you can connect to your own internal HTTP (not-encrypted) server, 
it may require you to learn iPXE script (my apologies in advance).

However, if you would like to connect to your own HTTPS (encrypted) cloud solution, please contact us. info@deploymentlive.com
